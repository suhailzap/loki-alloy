 docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' c284101f9df1

or http://prometheus:9090 
Grafana and Prometheus are both deployed using Docker?

The localhost of one container is not the localhost of another container, even if you published the port to the host – you can't reach the Prometheus container or the host using localhost from the Grafana container. You need to use the IP address of the Prometheus container, or the hostname if you are using Docker Compose.

If you need further help, please post your Docker configs (docker-compose.yml or docker run commands).

sudo apt install python3-pip




The issue you're facing with the Docker build process is due to network connectivity problems, specifically the inability to resolve DNS while trying to install Python packages via `pip`. Here are steps you can follow to resolve this:

### Steps to Fix Network Connectivity in Docker

1. **Check Your Network Configuration**:
   Ensure your host machine has internet access and DNS resolution works properly.

   ```bash
   ping google.com
   nslookup google.com
   ```

2. **Configure Docker DNS**:
   You can configure Docker to use a specific DNS server. Create or edit the Docker daemon configuration file `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and add the DNS settings.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
   ```

   Add the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "dns": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
   }
   ```

   Save and exit the file, then restart the Docker service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

3. **Retry Docker Compose**:
   Try running your Docker Compose setup again:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **Check Your Proxy Settings**: If you're behind a proxy, ensure Docker is configured to use the proxy.
- **Increase Retry Limit**: Modify the retry behavior of `pip` by adding retry settings in your `Dockerfile`:

   ```dockerfile
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --retries 10 --timeout 30 -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Example Dockerfile with Adjusted Pip Settings

Here’s how you can modify your Dockerfile to handle transient network issues better:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --retries 10 --timeout 30 -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Retry the Docker Build and Compose

After making these changes, retry the build and compose process:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

These steps should help you address the network connectivity issues during the Docker build process. If you still encounter issues, verify that there are no firewall rules or other network policies blocking Docker's access to the internet.
